# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wed, Jun 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've created 2 Dockerfile and followed the [Docker compose django example][Docker compose django example] and created a docker-compose bootstrap project. It's easy to use for us.

**Thoughts**:
- It's frustrating to have to wait for so long for the docker compose cmd to finish.
- Learnt that the PYTHONUNBUFFERED is important to flush real-time buffers.

**Link(s) to work**:
- [Docker compose django example](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/django.md)
- [PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/issues/319#issuecomment-405749895)
